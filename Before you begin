Create a project
In the Google Cloud Console, on the project selector page, select or create a Google Cloud project.
Make sure that billing is enabled for your Cloud project. Learn how to check if billing is enabled on a project .
You'll use Cloud Shell, a command-line environment running in Google Cloud that comes preloaded with bq. Click Activate Cloud Shell at the top of the Google Cloud console.
Once connected to Cloud Shell, you check that you're already authenticated and that the project is set to your project ID using the following command:
   gcloud auth list

Run the following command in Cloud Shell to confirm that the gcloud command knows about your project.
    gcloud config list project

If your project is not set, use the following command to set it:
   gcloud config set project <YOUR_PROJECT_ID>

Navigate to the Gemini for Google Cloud Marketplace to enable the API. You can also use the following command in the Cloud Shell terminal:
gcloud services enable spanner.googleapis.com --project PROJECT_ID
